# React Form Demo

A fully client-side form built with React to showcase form handling, validation, and responsive UI behavior. This project was designed to cover a wide range of form use cases including conditional inputs, real-time validation, and dynamic field updates.

  - Text inputs
  - Email and password fields
  - Select dropdowns
  - Radio buttons

  - Field matching (e.g. password confirmation)
  - Character limits
  - Pattern matching (email, URL, phone)
  - Custom rules (e.g. age >= 18)
- Real-time validation feedback
- Dynamic rendering (e.g. show/hide fields based on selections)
